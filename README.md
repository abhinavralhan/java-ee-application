# Electronic Voting System
> JavaEE Web Applications Course Project

> Team: Xray

The Electronic Voting System (EVS) facilitates electronic voting. This voting platform is web-based, enabling organizers to generate polls and formulate associated inquiries for said polls. The system accommodates three distinct question formats: binary (yes-no), single-selection, and multiple-choice questions. Voters possess the option to refrain from casting a vote. Upon the commencement of a poll, participants receive an email-delivered token, serving as their vote. Upon conclusion of the voting timeframe, the organizer gains access to a textual representation portraying the poll's outcomes.
